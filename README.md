Some portfolios are just *so* clean and well-crafted, you can't help but want to bring them into your own tech stack.

🚀 Just finished porting the stunning [iamsahaj.xyz](https://iamsahaj.xyz) (originally built with Astro) to [my version in Next.js](https://portfolio-two-eta-21.vercel.app) — fully responsive, lightning fast, and framework-ready!

🛠️ Tech Used: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI

💡 Inspired by great design. Rebuilt for performance.
