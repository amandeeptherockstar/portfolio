### ✨ My Portfolio

Some portfolios are so clean and inspiring, you can't resist rebuilding them — just to experiment, improve, and make them your own version.

🔥 I recently ported [**iamsahaj.xyz**](https://iamsahaj.xyz) (originally built with Astro) to [**https://portfolio-two-eta-21.vercel.app**](https://portfolio-two-eta-21.vercel.app), using a modern tech stack I truly enjoy working with:

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**

* Next.js 15 + React 19
* Tailwind CSS 4 + Typography plugin
* Contentlayer2 (with MDX + custom RSS)
* Iconify, Rehype/Remark plugins for MDX
* TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

⚡ Result: Fully responsive, performant, clean & extensible.
